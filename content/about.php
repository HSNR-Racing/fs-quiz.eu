			<p class="fs-5">My name is Yannik Ottens and I study computer science at the University of Bremen in Germany. I have been 
			a member of Bremergy since 2016 and I am currently part of the team leadership. From the beginning one of my tasks was to 
			prepare the team for the registration quizzes. For this I programmed some helpful tools and collected a lot of 
			data from the past quizzes. As my time at Bremergy is coming to an end, not at last because of the new rules (FSG A 4.2.8), 
			I want to make this data available to all teams. Therefore this page displays the collected data and offers a 
			possibility to train with it.</p>
