			<p class="fs-5">My name is Yannik Ottens and I study computer science at the University of Bremen in Germany. I have been a member of Bremergy since 2016 and was part of the team leadership for a long time. From the beginning, one of my tasks was to prepare the team for the registration quizzes. For this, I programmed some helpful tools and collected a lot of data from the past quizzes. As my time at Bremergy is coming to an end, I want to make this data available to all teams. Therefore this page contains the collected data and offers the possibility to train with it. More about this page in the <a href="/faq">FAQ.</a></p>
