  # Getting Started
  The fs-quiz.eu API V2 provides programmatic access to reading European Formula Student Quiz data. 
  Retrieve a quiz, individual questions or documents, filter them, etc.

  To use this API, in contrast to V1, **no API key is required**. Please try to **avoid unnecessary queries** 
  and use the queries carefull to keep the load on the server as low as possible. If you have any 
  questions or suggestions, please contact me at *api@fs-quiz.eu*.
  
  # Images
  The API gives the path to each image. To call up an image, the path is appended to *img.fs-quiz.eu*. 
  A fully functional image URL looks like this: *https://img.fs-quiz.eu/57_1.jpg*

  # Documents
  The current and former documents of the rules and events are stored in the database. In addition to 
  the year and version, each document is also assigned to a type. These are:
  - Rulebook: General rules of the season
  - Hybrid Rules: Rules for hybrid vehicles which are supported by some events
  - Additional Rules: Additional event specific rules that partly override the general rules
  - Handbook: Event Handbooks
  - Registration: Documents about the registration process
  - Additional Documents: Documents that are useful but do not fit into any other category
  Similar to the images, the API gives the path to each document. To access a document, the path is 
  appended to *doc.fs-quiz.eu*. A fully functional document URL looks like this: 
  *https://doc.fs-quiz.eu/FS-Rules_2023_v1.1.pdf*
