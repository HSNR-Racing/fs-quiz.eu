  # Getting Started
  The fs-quiz.eu API provides programmatic access to reading European Formula Student Quiz data. 
  Retrieve a quiz, individual questions or documents, filter them, etc.

  **To use this API, you will need an API-Key!** Please contact me at *api@fs-quiz.eu* to get your 
  own API-Key. The API-Key is used to limit the number of accesses and is completely free of 
  charge. This limitation is used to keep the server performance stable so please avoid unnecessary 
  accesses. More than **10 requests within one minute will result in a 10 minute timeout.**
  
  Please keep the API-Key for yourself and do not publish it. Each team gets only one API-Key, if 
  it gets lost you will get a new one, the old one will be deactivated!
  
  As the API-Keys are created manually, it takes a little time for the request to be processed. It 
  should not take longer than 24 hours. So that I can process the request directly, please write 
  a contactable email and the team name in the email.
  
  # Images
  The API gives the path to each image. To call up an image, the path is appended to *img.fs-quiz.eu*. 
  A fully functional image URL looks like this: *https://img.fs-quiz.eu/57_1.jpg*
  
  # Documents
  The current and former documents of the rules and events are stored in the database. In addition to 
  the year and version, each document is also assigned to a type. These are:
  - Rulebook: General rules of the season
  - Hybrid Rules: Rules for hybrid vehicles which are supported by some events
  - Additional Rules: Additional event specific rules that partly override the general rules
  - Handbook: Event Handbooks
  - Registration: Documents about the registration process
  - Additional Documents: Documents that are useful but do not fit into any other category
  Similar to the images, the API gives the path to each document. To access a document, the path is 
  appended to *doc.fs-quiz.eu*. A fully functional document URL looks like this: 
  *https://doc.fs-quiz.eu/FS-Rules_2023_v1.1.pdf*
